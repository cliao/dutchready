					When you already know how to play guitar and want to learn the saxophone, you don’t start by learning sheet music. You focus on how the two are different, and use what you already know to learn something new. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When you already know how to drive a car and want to learn how to drive a motorcycle, you don’t start by learning traffic rules. You focus on how the two are different, and use what you already know to learn something new.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why would learning a new language not be the same?
				</p>
				<p>
					Most people try to learn Dutch in one of two ways. Either they take traditional, often group-based, lessons or they try and learn through conversation. Traditional lessons are ineffective and take forever. They focus on the wrong things, teach you words or phrases you’ll never use, and more often than not you’re stuck either trying to catch up or wishing things would go faster. Meanwhile, learning through conversation is incredibly difficult, and only very few people actually stick with it long enough to become fluent.
				</p>
				<p>
					That’s why Dutch Ready uses a different approach.
				</p>
				<p>
					The natural way for your brain to pick up a new skill is to generalize. First you see what knowledge you already have, and then you try and simplify the knowledge you still need. Our method uses this important principle. We use what you already know from English to kickstart your Dutch. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Don’t learn harder, learn smarter.
				</p>
				<p>
					The beauty of this principle is that it applies to beginners, intermediate and advanced students. While you might focus on a different trick at a later stage, the idea stays the same: use what you already know, and simplify what you don’t.
				</p>
				<p>
					For instance, did you know that you secretly know hundreds of Dutch words already? Using so called cognates and loan words means you can train your vocabulary without having to memorize at all.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are just a few examples:<br>
					The taxi = Taxi (de)<br>
					The bar = Bar (de)<br>
					The restaurant = Restaurant (het)<br>
					The hand = Hand (de)<br>
					The lamp = Lamp (de)<br>
					The plant = Plant (de)<br>
					The wind = Wind (de)<br>
					Warm (adjective) = Warm<br>
					The lunch = Lunch (de)<br>
					The camera = Camera (de)<br>
					The weekend = Weekend (het)<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Or did you know that by learning changes in suffixes (word endings) and prefixes (word beginnings) you can often guess what the translation of a word will be? For instance, if you take English words with the suffix ‘-tion’ and replace those with the Dutch suffix ‘-tie’ you often get the Dutch word with the exact same meaning.
				</p>
				<p>
					Again, here are just a few examples:<br>
					Action = Actie (de)<br>
					Definition = Definitie (de)<br>
					Audition = Auditie (de)<br>
					Realization = Realizatie (de)<br>
					Intuition = Intuitie (de)<br>
					Animation = Animatie (de)<br>
					Donation = Donatie (de)<br>
					Edition = Editie (de)<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Even grammar, which might seem difficult, is much easier than you think. By following our suggested sentence structure it simply becomes a matter of dragging and dropping words. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A simple Dutch sentence breaks down into four parts: topic (red), the context (purple), the objects (blue) and the notorious ‘other verbs’ at the end (green). All you need to do is make sure the pieces are in the right place.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are a few basic sentences to give you an idea:<br>
					(though this applies to much more complicated sentences as well!)
				</p>
				<p>
					The student wants to learn Dutch quickly.<br>
					De student (subject) wil (finite) snel (manner) Nederlands (object)	leren (other verbs).
				</p>
				<p>
					The student can simply take lessons at home.<br>
					De student (subject) kan (finite) simpelweg (manner) thuis (place) lessen (object) volgen (other verbs).
				</p>
				<p>
					I practiced Dutch in my pyjamas on the couch this morning.<br>
					Ik (subject) heb (finite) vanochtend (time) in mijn pyjama (manner)	op de bank (place) Nederlands (object) geoefend (other verbs).
				</p>
				<p>
					Don’t worry about all the fancy language terms for now, just note how the different pieces are always in the same spot. The topic comes first, followed by the context and the object, with the remaining verbs at the end. Grammar really doesn’t need to be that difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using these tricks, and many more like them, we hope to give you the cheatcodes to learning Dutch quickly and easily. Even if you’ve already tried learning Dutch in the past.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember, it’s about learning smarter, not harder.
				</p>
