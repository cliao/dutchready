			<h1 class="white center">The natural way for your brain to pick up a new skill is to generalize. </h1>

				<h3>
					We use what you already know from English<br> to kickstart your Dutch.
				</h3>	
				<p>
					Most people try to learn Dutch with traditional, often group-based lessons, or through conversation. Traditional lessons are ineffective and based not on you, but the class as a whole. They focus on the wrong principles and more often than not, you’re either trying to catch up, or stuck wishing things would go faster. Meanwhile, learning through conversation is incredibly difficult, and only very few people actually stick with it long enough to become fluent.
				</p>
				<h3 class="topsm">
					That’s why Dutch Ready uses a different approach.
				</h3>

		<div class="container topsm">

				<img src="img/method-music.png" alt="Unique learning method for fast fluency">

					When you already know how to play guitar, and want to learn the saxophone, you don’t start by learning sheet music.

				<img src="img/method-driving.png" alt="Unique learning method for fast fluency">

					When you already know how to drive a car, and want to learn to drive a motorcycle, you don’t start by learning traffic rules. <br>

		<div class="container">
			<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-push-2 topsm">
				<p> 
					You focus on how the two are different, and use what you already know to learn something new. Why would learning a new language not be the same?
				</p>
				<h3 class="topsm">
					Don’t learn harder, learn smarter.
				</h3>
				<p>
					The beauty of this principle is that it applies to beginners, intermediate and advanced students. While you might focus on a different trick at a later stage, the idea stays the same: use what you already know, and simplify what you don’t.
				</p>
				<p>
					For instance, did you know that you secretly know hundreds of Dutch words already? Using so called cognates and loan words means you can train your vocabulary without having to memorize at all. Here are just a few examples:
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="container topmd">
			<div class="col-md-4 col-md-push-2">
				<p class="examples">
					the taxi = (de) taxi<br>
					the bar = (de) bar<br>
					the menu = (het) menu<br>
					the hand = (de) hand<br>
					the lamp = (de) lamp<br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-md-push-2">
				<p class="examples">
					the plant = (de) plant<br>
					the wind = (de) wind<br>
					the lunch = (de) lunch<br>
					the camera = (de) camera<br>
					the weekend = (het) weekend<br>
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-push-2 topmd">
				<p>

					Or did you know that by learning changes in suffixes (word endings) and prefixes (word beginnings) you can often guess what the translation of a word will be? For instance, if you take English words with the suffix ‘-tion’ and replace those with the Dutch suffix ‘-tie’ you often get the Dutch word with the exact same meaning. Again, here are just a few examples:
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="container topmd">
			<div class="col-md-4 col-md-push-2">
				<p class="examples">
					action = actie<br>
					definition = definitie<br>
					audition = auditie<br>
					realization = realizatie<br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-md-push-2">
				<p class="examples">
					intuition = intuitie<br>
					animation = animatie<br>
					donation = donatie<br>
					edition = editie<br>
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-push-2 topmd">
				<h3>
					Even grammar, which might seem difficult,<br> is much easier than you think.
				</h3>
				<p>
					By following our suggested sentence structure, it simply becomes a matter of dragging and dropping words. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A simple Dutch sentence breaks down into four parts: subject and verb (red), the context (purple), the objects (blue) and the notorious other verbs at the end (green). All you need to do is make sure the pieces are in the right place.
				</p>
				<p class="examples topmd">
					The student wants to learn Dutch quickly.<br>
					<red>De student wil</red> <purple> snel</purple> <blue>Nederlands</blue> 	<green>leren</green>.
				</p>
				<p class="examples">
					The student can simply take lessons at home.<br>
					<red>De student kan</red> <purple> simpelweg thuis</purple> <blue>lessen</blue> <green>volgen</green>.
				</p>
				<p class="examples">
					I practiced Dutch in my pyjamas on the couch this morning.<br>
					<red>Ik heb</red> <purple> vanochtend in mijn pyjama op de bank</purple> <blue>Nederlands</blue> <green>geoefend</green>.
				</p>
				<p class="topmd">
					Don’t worry about all the fancy language terms for now, just note how the different pieces are always in the same spot. The topic comes first, followed by the context and the object, with the remaining verbs at the end. Grammar really doesn’t need to be that difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using these tricks, and many more like them, we hope to give you the cheats to learning Dutch quickly and easily. Even if you’ve already tried learning Dutch in the past.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember, it’s about learning smarter, not harder.
				</p>
				<h3 class="topsm">Money Back Guarantee</h3>
				<p>If for any reason Dutch Ready doesn't live up to your expectations, or maybe your financial situation has changed, just let us know before your third lesson. No forms, no hoops. We make cancelling easy.</p>
